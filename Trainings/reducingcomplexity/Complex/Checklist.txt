	Ways To Reduce Complexity
	-------------------------

	Factor out duplicate code into separate methods (#001)
	
	Factor out non-domain logic into separate modules (#002)
	
	Factor out discrete domain logic into separate methods/modules (#003)
	
	Validate input, return or throw error on failure (#004)
	
	Validate domain data, return or throw error on failure (#005)
	
	Execute domain logic (#006)
	
	Use comments to explain why, not what (#007)
	
	Don't optimize at the expense of readability (#008)
	
	Declare variables right before the logic in which they are used (#009)
	
	Don't use the same variable for multiple purposes (#010)
	
	Don't try to minimize the number of method calls (#011)
	
	Allow multiple returns from a method if it improves readability or cyclomatic complexity (#012)
	
	Keep the happy path has flat as possible (#013)
	
	Separate levels of abstraction (#014)
	
	Use variables to give meaningful names to complex computations (#015)
